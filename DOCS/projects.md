# Color Snake Projects and ideas

to keep my project names consistent,
(I kind of messed up on gitlab, because I have different groups.)
But on github is where I want it to look good.


**colorsnake_web_playground**
web playground for color snake

**colorsnake_electron**
deskop color picker app

**colorsnake_obsidian**
obsidian vault for organizing colors and color palettes

CLI?

**colorsnake_cli_python**
python cli color picker

**colorsnake_cli_go**
go cli color picker
